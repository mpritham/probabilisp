## Overview

Probabilistic reasoning is used in many domains, including financial stock
prediction, intrusion detection for cybersecurity, and image recognition.
Probabilistic programming is a paradigm in which a user specifies parameters for
their desired probability models and inference is performed automatically.
Probabalisp is a simple Lisp-like domain specific probabilistic programming
language. The primary goal of Probabalisp is to make probability primitives
accessible to programmers, while abstracting away the details of the
mathematical computation. To this end, Probabalisp is able to represent problems that would require several lines of dense math library code with simple functions, e.g. `uniform`, `sample`, and `select`.
